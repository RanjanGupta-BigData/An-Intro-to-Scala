## Creating a Tuple

In Scala, tuples are immutable and can hold elements of different types. Here’s an example.

*input*

```
val junk_tup = (6, 3.14, “elephant”, true)
```

*output*

```
junk_tup: (Int, Double, String, Boolean) = (6,3.14,elephant,true)
```

## Indexing Tuples

Tuples start at index “1” rather than “0” and have a unique indexing method as illustrated below.

*input*

```
junk_tup._2
```

*output*

```
res0: Double = 3.14
```

In this example, we grabbed the 2nd element from our tuple, which was “3.14”.
