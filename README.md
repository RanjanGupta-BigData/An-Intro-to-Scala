# Part 1: Installation, Setup, and "Hello World"

Welcome to the first article in my multi-part series on Scala. This tutorial is designed as a precursor to learning Apache Spark.

Spark is an open-source cluster-computing framework designed for big data processing. It is written in Scala. Spark can be run in Python (PySpark) and R (SparkR and sparklyr); however, the best performance with Spark can be achieved in Scala.

Scala is an object-oriented and functional programming language. Itâ€™s is most closely related to Java, so Java programmers should have a leg up on learning it. However, Scala is designed to be more concise and have features of functional programming languages.

**References and Resources** 

I will offer some other sources as both alternatives to my own blogs as well as references. Jose Portilla's Udemy courses are great and my blog will series will loosely follow the structure for his "Scala and Spark for Big Data and Machine Learning" course. If you learn better in video format, I highly recommend that course.
Marius Eriksen of Twitter has published "Effective Scala", which is available online for free. That's a great resource, as well.
If you're coming from a Python background, you might also check out this Python to Scala e-book, written by Rob Story. It's pretty short and sweet and serves as a good quick reference for all you Pythoners and Pythonistas out there!
